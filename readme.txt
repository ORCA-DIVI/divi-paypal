== Description ==

= Introduction =

PayPal for Divi adds a PayPal Button module into the Divi page builder tool making it quick and easy to add PayPal Buy Now and Donate buttons to any WordPress page or post built with Divi.

 * Buy Now Button
 * Donate Button 

= Divi Theme by Elegant Themes Compatibility =
This plugin is built specifically for the Divi theme.  If you would like to add PayPal buttons to a non-Divi WordPress site, take a look at our [PayPal WP Button Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paypal-wp-button-manager/) plugin.

= Quality Control =
Payment processing can't go wrong.  It's as simple as that.  Our certified PayPal engineers have developed and thoroughly tested this plugin on the PayPal sandbox (test) servers to ensure your customers don't have problems paying you.  

= Seamless PayPal Integration =
No more leaving the WordPress admin panel to log in to PayPal, create your button, copy HTML code, return to WordPress to paste the code, and finally save your page.  Instead, simply drop the button into the page using the Divi module and you're done within seconds!

= Localization = 
This plugin was developed with localization in mind and is ready for translation.
